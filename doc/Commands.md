First, eval evaluates every argument, then concatenates them with a whitespace, 
and finally executes the resulting string as a command.
The string 'echo $(1+1)' is evaluated to "echo 2.000000", which is then executed.

eval spawn ./Resources/RenderObjects/{global.ToSpawn}.json

- Creating complex control flows in scripts.
```

#### `if`

```
Executes a block of code if a condition is true.

Usage: if <condition> <functioncall>

It is recommended to wrap the condition in quotes to prevent parsing issues.

However, This is not supported for in-console usage. 
This is because the console itself removes quotes before passing the arguments to the FuncTree,
rendering them useless.

Example:
if '$(eq(1+1,2))' echo Condition is true!
```
