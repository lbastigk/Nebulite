# @brief Test multi-resolve within a Nebulite expression
# @description This test checks that multiple resolve calls within a single Nebulite expression are handled correctly.
# Example usage:
# {global.foo.{bar}} turns into {global.foo.value1.value2} if bar resolves to value1.value2
# Then, {global.foo.value1.value2} is resolved to the final value.
echo Testing multi-resolve in Nebulite expressions
set bar value1.value2
set foo.value1.value2 final_value

# Normal resolution for comparison
eval echo {global.foo.value1.value2}
# Expected output: final_value

# Now, try to resolve {global.foo.{bar}}
eval echo {global.foo.{bar}}
# Expected output: final_value
